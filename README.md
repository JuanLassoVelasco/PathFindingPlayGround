# PathFindingPlayGround
Set of different path finding algorithms implemented in C# using the Unity Game engine

If you want to see and experiment with different path finding examples you can clone this repo to test and play around 

## What you'll need

- Unity Game Engine
- C# compliler (Visual Studio works if you don't have a prefered compliler)
- Code editor (if you don't already have one)

## How to run

The visuals for the path finding algorithm were built using the unity game engine, so once you've cloned or downloaded the repo you can open one of
the scenes in the Assets/Scenes folder to open and run the examples. The scene should automatically open in Unity if you have it downloaded.

You can explore and edit the source code for the different path finding algorithms as you please, there are also design levers in the unity editor
for each path finder.
